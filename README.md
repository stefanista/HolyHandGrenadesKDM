## Overview
The biomedical area we have chosen to research and work on is mental health. Specifically, we will be conducting research and analyzing data sets pertaining to the treatment of depression for patients.

Depression interferes with the daily life and normal functioning of a person, manifesting in various symptoms such as sadness, “emptiness”, guilt, feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness, loss of interest in activities or hobbies once enjoyable, thoughts of suicide or death, and weight changes [1]. Factors that play a role in depression include genetics, brain chemistry, and traumatic life events [1]. Treatment for depression consists of medication, therapy, or a combination of the two as each individual experiences the effects of depression differently and should seek the treatment that best fits them [1].

## Existing Ontologies
The below proposed ontology focuses on collecting data through adolescent usage of social media. The researchers analyzed the thoughts, feelings, and interests adolescents conveyed over social media and conducted sentiment analysis on these findings, gathering insight on the nature of depression within this age population and how their behavior is influenced from it.

The ontology created by the authors, in conjunction with a Bayesian network, allowed them to build an inference model for finding the probability of an individual of becoming depressed. The ontology was created by incorporating terminology used to describe depression.

The authors provide an ontology to reduce confusion and conflations regarding the existing terminologies used to describe instances of mental disease.
